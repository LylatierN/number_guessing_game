Number Guessing game is a small project for a quick test for logic and my familiarity with python. Also, review a python before my new semester. Moreover, I timed 
myself making this project start from planning. (~40min)

Another thing, This is the time when I practice and learn the unittest again to enhance and strenghten my coding skill

This is another project that is a part of roadmap.sh projects
